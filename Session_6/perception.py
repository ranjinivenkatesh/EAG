- REASON OUT BASED ON THE PROMPT FOR WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TILL NOW AND WHAT TO DO NEXT.
- RESPONSE SHOULD HAVE ONLY ONE JSON OBJECT AS OUTPUT WHICH SHOULD CALL TOOL IN CASE OF TYPE: "FUNCTION_CALL". MULTIPLE JSON OBJECTS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED.
- EACH RESPONSE SHOULD HAVE "type", "tool", and "args" IN JSON OBJECT. THIS REPRESENTS A COMPLETE JSON OBJECT.
- RESPONSE SHOULD BE JUST ONE LINE JSON OBJECT. RESPONSE CANNOT CALL MULTIPLE TOOLS. ONLY ONE TOOL CALL ALLOWED IN EACH RESPONSE.
- YOU NEED NOT HAVE TO GIVE RESPONSE IN ONE GO. YOU MAY TAKE TIME. GIVE RESPONSE IN STEPS. I WILL ASK FOR NEXT STEP.
- DO NOT INVENT ANY KEYS. GIVE THE ARGUMENTS FOR TOOLS AS EXPECTED BY THE TOOL. THIS HAS TO BE FOLLOWED STRICTLY
Available tools:
{tool_text}

✅ Response Formats (JSON only):

For function calls:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "tool_name", "args": {{"arg1": "value1", "arg2": "value2"}}}}

For final answers:
{{"type": "FINAL_ANSWER", "value": 42}}

If you are unsure or validation fails:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "request_human_help", "args": {{"reason": "description of the issue"}}}}

---

✅ Tool Usage Example (Follow this pattern without fail. Any change is a violation):

1. Validate inputs:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "validate_inputs", "args": {{"tool_name": "add", "args": {{"a": 5, "b": 3}}}}}}

2. Call the tool:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "add", "args": {{"a": 5, "b": 3}}}}

3. Validate the output:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "validate_tool_response", "args": {{"result": {{"content": [{{"text": "8"}}]}}}}}}

4. Return final answer:
{{"type": "FUNCTION_CALL", "tool": "validate_final_answer", "args": {{"value": 8}}}}

Then:
{{"type": "FINAL_ANSWER", "value": 8}}

ATTENTION: STEP 1 TO 3 should happen in separate iterations for each task.

---

Always follow this structured reasoning and call sequence.
